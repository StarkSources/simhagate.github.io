The schedule followed in GO Classroom for GATE 2019

Please see here for [GO Book](https://gateoverflow.in/blog/4490/go-hardcopy-2019) for GATECSE 2019

Advantages of following this schedule:

It is not the only good schedule possible but is one schedule where subject dependencies are met 
You can ask any doubt from the topics already covered in the schedule here with the tag go-classroom and those will be answered with priority
Preparation materials including reference links are provided on GO classroom as per the schedule
Even if you are joining late, you can adjust your schedule accordingly - most assignments in GO classroom will allow late submissions and this schedule is expected to be over by November end.
